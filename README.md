### Note(s)

Need to wait for [this](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/pull/6633) PR to be merged before module import aliasing starts working for CRA with Jest. Alternative solution can be found [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/5652) but it suggests to use yet another dependency, not a big fan of dependencies.
